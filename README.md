# Morz'O'Mod
### My Balatro mod, as my any first mod it is named Morz'O'Mod
Currently it adds a few jokers, new type of joker and booster packs for this new type of joker

## New type of jokers - Pile jokers
Pile jokers are jokers that are literally just a pile of some (generally) metal.
There are 4 booster packs for Pile jokers (2 normal, 1 jumbo, 1 mega). Because the Pile jokers appear very rarely in the shop.
All Pile jokers generally reset their value after shop reroll.

## Coming soon - New type of consumables - Alphabet cards
Alphabet cards ***will be*** a new type of consumables, consisting of 24 Greek letters, and a few more of secret ones!
